            About Me
          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg mb-8 text-gray-600">
            Hi, I’m Erini Hoffman, a passionate designer from Sweden. I specialize in creating meaningful digital experiences and have a deep love for design, creativity, and innovation.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-8 text-gray-600">
            I grew up in a small village in Sweden. My family was not very wealthy, and life was a bit of a struggle. Despite the challenges, I always dreamed big and worked hard. Eventually, I packed my bags and moved to Greece, a journey that changed my life and inspired my creativity.
